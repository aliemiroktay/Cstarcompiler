# Cstarcompiler
(note: description is old. will be updated after everything is OK.)
A brand new programming Language: ?C, and its compiler. Now, it is overly simple, and will be getting updates.
Generally, made for improving myself in c. These are the only available codes:
(note: Mostly like c, but has different keywords, and more useful loops will be added.)
# Keywords:
noreviewed; void in c.\
2rewieved; boolean.\
reviewed; int.\
lreviewed; long.\
build; struct.\
mreviewed; float.\
# functions:
oprint(same as c here); print.\
# some program:


@\?xhport /stdio:
@\?xhport /stdbool:

nonreviewed test<<>>{
    oprint<<"hello!">>;
}

reviewed main<<>> {
    reviewed num = 42;
    lreviewed bigNum = 1234567890;
    2reviewed isTrue = 1;
    mreviewed pi = 3.14;
    oprint<<"Number: %d\n", num>>;
    oprint<<"Big Number: %ld\n", bigNum>>;
    oprint<<"Boolean: %d\n", isTrue>>;
    oprint<<"Pi: %.2f\n", pi>>;
    test<<>>;
}
